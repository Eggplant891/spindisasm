--- ANIMATION FRAME DATA FORMAT ---

0x00FF - anim_data_1 => Current Frame data
0x00FF - anim_data_3 => Next Frame data
  - 0x007F - Target sprite index (looked up at 0xFFAD52 or 0xFFAD12 for the player.
  - Anything less than 0x40 seems to be reading from => 0xFFAB78 + (2 * current_anim_id). This seems to be a pool of IDs or commands?
  - When it is > 0x40, there is still a check to see if var-0x40 is < 6. If not, there is then an attempt to do var-0x46 and check if that's < 6. Seems like a special case for the player, but unclear on the second check
0x6000 - anim_data_2
  - if anim_data_2 == 0x2000 => return value of frame sprite index.
  - if not, progress anim frame ptr 1 frame (+2 since frames are shorts). This is then stored and the frame ptr jumps 2 again (presumably as there is 2 more bytes of data to follow)
  
  0x4000 - Command flag
  0x2000 - Frame jump flag
