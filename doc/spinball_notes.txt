---Spinball Notes---

-- Physics Notes --

- When spindashing, the game attempts to raycast immediately to the nearest walkable platform below the player

-- Release USA Notes --
0xA16F6 - Could be pinball fortress tile map?

-- General Notes --

0xFF0005 - Player 1 input mask. Used in: Options, In-game, Bonus Stage. Not used on Main Menu or intro videos however.
0xFF573D - Player input mask

0xFFF2E4 - Some kind of Heap for rendering sprites and tiles

---Sonic Object---
Player movement when standing or in barrel is only moved in whole integer values.
Speeds of player when walking/running are only ever whole integer values.

$FFF1FA (short) - (possibly general/global) Timer countdown. Observed usages for the player class
								- Used for each "Yo move it"/"Hey anybody home" states for sonic. Continuously decrements even when sonic is in the laziest waiting state.
								- Used for the delay between each spindash upshift in pitch
								- Used to time the delay between pressing jump and sonic actually jumping
$FFF20A (short) - Timer that counts up during gameplay. Possibly used for time bonus.

-- Level Select Cheat Code --
Entirely based on input combinations, nothing to do with the options cursor itself.
Level select code check counts up at memory address FF5750. Correct input ++count. Incorrect input resets count to 0.

-- Options --
#FF035E | Number of players (00 = 1p, 01 = 2p, 02 = 3p, 03 = 4p)
#FF035F | Speed (00 = Normal, 01 = Fast)
=> Affects #FFF8D8 (0E = Normal, 13 = Fast) - Appears to increase the force of collisions. Simulation speed is the same
#FF0360 | Music (00 = On, 01 = Off)
#FF0361 | Flipper (00 = A-Left, B-Right, C-All, 01 = A-Left, B-All, C-Right, 02= A-All, B-Left, C-Right)

-- Tiling System --
Collision tiles referenced on ROM via ptr at 0xFFF1F4

Collision Tiles are 128x128px
Level tiling allows for up to 16 tiles horizontally (max width of 2048px)
Vertical limit seems arbitarily large. Could be 20 based on memory initialisation of 320 in LevelTileInitialisation.

CollisionTileData seems to be a ptr to an array of shorts.
collision_tile
[0] = xpos
[1] = ypos
[2] = some value subtracted from a vector distance calculation
[4] = tile flags?

-- Jingles --
0x11 - Danger
0x12 - Success!
0x17 - Extra Ball / Great Escape
