---Spinball Notes---

-- General Notes --

$FF0005 - Player 1 input mask. Used in: Options, In-game, Bonus Stage. Not used on Main Menu or intro videos however.
$FF573D - Player input mask

0xFFF2E4 - Some kind of Heap for rendering sprites and tiles

---Sonic Object---
Player movement when standing or in barrel is only moved in whole integer values.
Speeds of player when walking/running are only ever whole integer values.

$FFF1FA (short) - (possibly general/global) Timer countdown. Observed usages for the player class
								- Used for each "Yo move it"/"Hey anybody home" states for sonic. Continuously decrements even when sonic is in the laziest waiting state.
								- Used for the delay between each spindash upshift in pitch
								- Used to time the delay between pressing jump and sonic actually jumping
$FFF20A (short) - Timer that counts up during gameplay. Possibly used for time bonus.

-- Level Select Cheat Code --
Entirely based on input combinations, nothing to do with the options cursor itself.
Level select code check counts up at memory address FF5750. Correct input ++count. Incorrect input resets count to 0.

-- Options --
#FF035E | Number of players (00 = 1p, 01 = 2p, 02 = 3p, 03 = 4p)
#FF035F | Speed (00 = Normal, 01 = Fast)
=> Affects #FFF8D8 (0E = Normal, 13 = Fast) - Appears to increase the force of collisions. Simulation speed is the same
#FF0360 | Music (00 = On, 01 = Off)
#FF0361 | Flipper (00 = A-Left, B-Right, C-All, 01 = A-Left, B-All, C-Right, 02= A-All, B-Left, C-Right)
